# Scryfall2DH

This workbook is designed to help retrieve a list of 2DH-playable cards directly from Scryfall's built-in API. In each case, the lowest price seen for each card is retrieved.

Non-native Python Dependencies:
- pandas

If you are not familiar with running python code, I would recommend running this program in Google Colab (click the button at the top of the code to open Colab).
